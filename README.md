# Optimisation Design of IIR Filter using
# Application Specific IC Design

Demonstrated implementation of Optimisation and Unoptimised Variant's Verilog Code Files 

With the evolution of electronic devices, the demand for sophisticated
high performance, low area and low power consumption Application Specific
Processor (ASP) is ever increasing, which aims to process a particular functional
application. This project focuses on design of IIR butterworth filter, which is used
to demonstrate the High Level Synthesis (HLS) design flow providing the
general comprehensive diagnostic pathway to design the same. The proposed
project will proceed using the help of Verilog for coding. The optimised variation
for IIR butterworth filter will be synthesized at RTL. The most optimum result
based on latency time, cycle time and area unit area will be implemented on
Virtex FPGA board.
